## 📌 Overview

The **Crowd Monitoring and Alert System** is an AI-based real-time surveillance solution that detects people in a video stream, analyzes crowd density, generates heatmaps, and automatically sends alerts when crowd levels exceed predefined thresholds.

The system integrates deep learning, computer vision, and automated notification mechanisms to provide an intelligent crowd management solution suitable for smart cities, public safety, and large-scale event monitoring.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect people in real-time using a deep learning model (YOLOv8).
- Count the number of individuals in a given scene.
- Analyze crowd density and classify risk levels.
- Visualize crowd distribution using heatmaps.
- Trigger automated alerts via email when crowd thresholds are exceeded.
- Support integration with IoT devices (Arduino).
